## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

The term API is now widely used in programming. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and even 
today it can be considered something quite vague - the interface between one software system and another.

APIs are typically documented with a description of how to make calls, and the format of the resulting data.

Today many APIs are programming language independent and use network connections. Such APIs are sometimes called Web APIs.

For the purpose of this module (Systems Development 2) we will consider the term API can be applied to both software libraries and Web APIs.

## Web APIs

### RESTful


## The eBay APIs

For the assignment you are required to use data from an online shopping service.


## CRUD

## HTTP and URIs

```
URI = scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]
```

The term URLs is generally used where the scheme (network protocol) is HTTP or HTTPS in which case the ```authority``` is a network ```host``` and ```port``` (80 and 443 are the defaults).

## HTTP verbs
